# GitHub Setup Instructions

Your project is committed and ready to push to GitHub!

## Next Steps:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `kids-website-nextjs` (or any name you prefer)
3. Description: "Kids Website converted to Next.js with SSR, SSG, ISR, and CSR"
4. Make it **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kids-website-nextjs.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Alternative: If you already have a repository URL

Just replace the URL in the command above with your repository URL.
