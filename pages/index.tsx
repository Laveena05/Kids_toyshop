/* 
 * RENDERING STRATEGY SUMMARY:
 * ============================
 * 
 * SSR (Server-Side Rendering):
 *   - DailyAdvice component
 *   - Fresh content on every request
 *   - getServerSideProps runs on server for each page load
 * 
 * CSR (Client-Side Rendering):
 *   - Menu component (interactive state)
 *   - ToyCard components (flip animations)
 *   - Uses 'use client' directive and React hooks
 * 
 * SSG (Static Site Generation):
 *   - Hero, PopularToys, Gallery, Footer components
 *   - Pre-rendered at build time
 *   - Served as static HTML - best performance
 * 
 * ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):
 *   - Available via pages/index-isr.tsx.example
 *   - Combines SSG benefits with periodic updates
